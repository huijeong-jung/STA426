### Sampling 100 values from a log-normal distribution
```{r}
samples <- rlnorm(100, meanlog = 1, sdlog = 0.25)
```

### Histogram of log-normal distribution
```{r}
hist(samples)
hist(log(samples))
```

### Mean and Variance of sample
```{r}
mean<-mean(samples)
variance<-var(samples)
```
The mean is `r mean`
The variance is `r variance`
