### Sampling 100 values from a log-normal distribution
In the first part of the exercise, we are sampling 100 values from a log-normal distribution where the mu is 1 and sigma is 0.25. In a log-normal distribution, the mu represents the logarithmic average for the distribution function, and the sigma represents the scatter. 
```{r}
samples <- rlnorm(100, meanlog = 1, sdlog = 0.25)
```

### Histogram of log-normal distribution
This part of the exercise shows the histogram of the distribution of the sample and the distribution on log scale. 
```{r}
hist(samples)
hist(log(samples))
```

### Mean and Variance of sample
```{r}
mean<-mean(samples)
variance<-var(samples)
```
To conclude, the mean of the sample is `r mean` and the variance is `r variance`.
